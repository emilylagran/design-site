                        <h5>
                            With a team of 3 and a two week sprint the journey began. ABC Market needed to enter the 
                            technology arena so that it could compete with major players such as Amazon and Walmart. 
                            However, their goal was more than just creating an online grocery app. ABC wanted to keep 
                            their premium shopping experience even in their new application. With the goals laid out, 
                            our team began the adventure.

                        The research process included many trips to grocery stores and many 
                        snacks to fill the time of observing shoppers. Our team conducted 15 guerrilla interviews. 
                        This qualitative research provided many insights for our team and gave the project direction 
                        and focus. The data collected gave light to peoples relationship with grocery shopping- most 
                        of those relationships were cast in a negative and tedious light.

                        The pain points, gains, and motivations of the user were all in one diagram where we could see them clearly.

                        After discovering the users needs and motivations a persona needed to be created. 
                        The persona is used in user-centered design to keep us designers focused on the users needs 
                        and not our own. The persona is based off of data gathered during the research process. In this 
                        project the persona is Busy Stacy- a doctor who is always on the go but wants to maintain a healthy 
                        lifestyle. Busy Stacy represents the tribe that ABC Market wishes to cater to.

                                During this phase our team got together to brainstorm for solutions on saving Busy Stacy’s time. 
                                The solutions needed to push past the obvious ideas. ABC Market needed to stand out in the market 
                                which means we needed to find a key distinguishing feature. 
                                The only way to find this feature is through a process of brainstorming and filtering.

                    <p>
                        The filtering process, or the feature prioritization process is 
                        where all the solutions go through a check point. Two methodologies were used: 
                        the MoSCoW method and an impact vs. effort chart. It is through this process that 
                        we get ABC Market’s minimum viable product. And from there- the key distinguishing 
                        feature. For ABC the KDF is “set & forget” a recurring delivery option for the products 
                        the user gets repeatedly.

                        We time boxed ourselves and did a couple rounds of crazy 8. 
                        Crazy 8 is where a timer is set for 8 minutes and each individual must 
                        draw 8 design concepts (in our case we did 9). The sketches are then voted on. 
                        The sketches with the most votes moves on to the low fidelity wireframing phase. 
                        Here- a flow starts to be established and the information architecture becomes the priority.

                        The UI for ABC Market had to reflect the premium shopping experience. They needed to stand out from the 
                        rest as they do with their brick and mortar stores. The color orange was chosen for it’s 
                        uniqueness and vibrant energy. The white gave the clean simplistic feel that would give the user 
                        a sense of ease. Our team created a mood-board as well as the style tile you see here. These were run 
                        through desirability tests to see if the brand attributes of ABC Market were apparent with the style we 
                        established- and they were right on point.

                        During testing we found some issues where the user felt like the 
                        “set & forget” feature needed to take less time. We started off with 
                        a pop up module with 4 input boxes. Using agile methodology we were able 
                        to test as we moved forward. Finally, we left it off with 2 input boxes. 
                        The “set and forget” feature was not ready for hand off.

                        This project was a challenge and a learning experience. The needs of the client were straight foward and simple. The pains of the user were universal. This project required my team to think outside of this box and push past the obvious. Having the user in the center guided us through difficult questions and design chaos. However- in the end we achieved order and victory.

                                            With a team of 3 and a two week sprint the journey began. ABC Market needed to enter the technology arena so that it could compete with major 
                                            players such as Amazon and Walmart. However, there goal was more than just creating an oline grocery app. ABC wanted to keep their premium shopping experience even in their new application. 
                                            With the goals laid out, our team began the adventure.

                                        I start by following reminding myself of the Stanford D. School Design Thinking Process. This is the foundation for all the work I do as a UXUI designer. I like to recreate the phases and populate it with my projects needs. By doing this I orient myself in the right direction.

                                            5 individuals were tested for this project. This qualitative research provided many insights for our team and gave the project a direction and focus. One individual mentioned that they “hate waiting in long lines for the same items they get every week.” Another individual said, “grocery shopping shouldn’t take so long.” 
                                        </p>

                                        <p>Using an affinity map we sorted through all the insights from the research and began to organize it all. Our team began to see a recurring theme; time was the biggest pain point for ABC Market’s clients. </p>

                                        To get a better understanding of how wasting time affects ABC’s clients we needed to get a 360 degree view of the user. This is done through an empathy map. An empathy map places me as a UX designer into the shows of the user.

                                        Using the data our team gathered up to this point we needed to create a persona. The persona would help guide us during the design process so we insure that the users needs are being addressed at all times. The persona is made with data and should represent the target user. For ABC, Busy Stacy represented the tribe. With her in mind we were able to tailor the design decisions toward her lifestyle, and needs.

                                        Placing Busy Stacy in a real world scenario allowed our team to see the context of her high and low points when grocery shopping at ABC. This is crucial because it shows the opportunities for design with a real world application.

                                        Everyone wants to save time this is a common pain point for any user. However, during this project this issue stood out the most. The user did not want to spend time buying items they bought religiously. The problem was in plain sight.

                                            Our team gathered together to ideate and came up with a plethora of possible ideas to solve the issue of time. Once we emptied out our brains of every possible idea these ideas needed to go through a filtering process. For feature prioritization we used the MoSCoW method and the impact verses effort chart.

                                        <p>Finally, we were able to come up with a feature that would address Stacy’s issue: a recurring delivery feature.

                                        Now to implement the solutions. First we sketched it and voted on the best sketches that make the most sense for the users. It then progressed into the mid-fidelity phase where we found some issues in the flow. There was too much of a cognitive load to set a recurring delivery. The way the flow was created required the user to know the exact order they wanted delivered. This was making the user think too much about what they wanted to set up. So we switched that. We adjusted the flow so that the user can shop like usual and at the end before they confirm their order they are asked if they want to make anything a recurring purchase. This required less planning.

With this in mind, we knew the interface had to be clean and welcoming. A vibrant orange was used in the logo and for the active states of the icons because it gave a great spark of color to the primarily white screen. Green was used for buttons and titles to go with the organic grocery store feeling. Light-weighted icons were used to give off a clean and simple look for the user. </p>
