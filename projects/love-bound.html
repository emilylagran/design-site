                            Love Bound is an app that helps couples create deeper connections. Love Bound is used by 
                            relationship coaches from NWI to monitor and aid couples 
                            through tough moments. It is also used by couples who simply want to optimize their partnership. 
                            The app provides proactive bond strengthening and relationship counseling for those that don’t always see eye to eye.

                        For this project, the app idea needed to be 
                        validated against the market. The first step was 
                        to see what other apps existed in this industry that 
                        catered to people in relationships. There were not 
                        many at all. Most apps were for people that were 
                        seeking a relationship; not people already in a 
                        relationship. The process started with understanding 
                        the nature of the industry itself and why it existed in 
                        the first place. The next step was to look into the details. 
                        This is where the feature comparison chart came into play. It 
                        contains a list of existing competitors and their features. The features 
                        that exist in all or most of the apps are the users mental models. This 
                        is what the users are expecting to see. The features not overlapping 
                        are unique to their app these are features I could either validate 
                        through testing or possibly stay away from if its not a vital part of 
                        the users mental models. The chart then helps me place the companies 
                        on a market positioning map which tells me where the blue ocean is- 
                        this is the area with the most opportunity- an area in the market nobody 
                        has explored. Being that Love Bound doesn’t actually exist yet the first
                        priority was to get it on the market and moving rapidly toward that blue
                        ocean.

                        The user research was my favorite part of this project. 
                        I was able to connect with many people and listen to their 
                        stories. I sent out surveys and received 102 responses. I also
                        interviewed 10 individuals. The data received was detailed and 
                        personal. Often it almost felt like a therapy session and I was 
                        the therapist allowing them a form of release.

                        Synthesizing the data was done with an affinity map. I 
                        gathered information, grouped the information, and spotted 
                        any trends or patterns. I found that many of the triggers 
                        overlapped across individuals. Stress from the day was burdening 
                        couples. If someone had a bad day at work they often had residual 
                        irritation from their day seep into their relationship in the form 
                        of attitudes and negative tones of voice. The pain points became my 
                        focus in this project because the goal was to heal any unmet needs. 
                        The secondary focus was the habits and motivations of the user- these 
                        would help me in optimizing they relationship habits.

                        Using the data I created a persona that would represent the target market the app 
                        would serve. The persona is based on the “average user” or the couples already 
                        interested in strengthening their relationship on their own accord. 
                        Because of my time restrictions I stuck to just making one persona. 
                        The persona is from the female perspective. This is because I noticed 
                        that many of the relationship apps were aimed towards women. A males 
                        POV would have been amazing but I needed to pick one POV to start the 
                        project so since more data was from the female perspective it made more 
                        sense to have a female representative. If I had more time I would have 
                        had the male POV as well.

                                In this phase I called in for help- it was crucial that the ideas were 
                                not only from me. So I called in another designer who also happened to 
                                be one of the people I interviewed for this project. Together we time 
                                boxed ourselves and let our creative juices flood the room. We came up 
                                with a plethora of possible solutions. The process had Annoyed Annie in 
                                the center- since this is user centered design. We chose three of the 
                                major issues found in the research phase and we created how might we 
                                statements. This guided our brainstorming session.

                        Now, we needed to converge. After coming up with a lot of solutions 
                        we needed to filter them. For the feature prioritization process 
                        I used the MoSCoW method and impact vs. effort chart. Through this 
                        process we were able to create the MVP. This set the tone for the 
                        rest of the design process.

                    <p>
                        The flow for the key distinguishing feature needed 
                        to be extremely quick because the KDF would be a tool 
                        they could use while they were experiencing an emotional 
                        pain body or even extremely joyful. When one experiences 
                        these emotions- they cannot think clearly and they can 
                        enter into a positive feedback loop where the negative 
                        emotions become exponentially worse. With this in mind 
                        quick was the priority. The KDF was an alert that the 
                        emotional partner would send out to their partner. This 
                        is tracked with a calendar so they can spot any emotional 
                        trends. The alert is there to help the couple communicate 
                        their emotional state before they see each other. The idea 
                        behind this is to allow the other partner to adjust their 
                        approach to the emotional partner- or to give them the chance 
                        of taking some space. And the emotional partner has a signpost 
                        which shows why there would be any unintended attitudes.

                        After the flow was determined the low fidelity wireframes 
                        gave us version one of what the app would look like. To 
                        determine the placement of the content I used the crazy 8 
                        method and had possible users vote on the layout they felt 
                        they understood the most. Once there was a winner among the 
                        sketches I created the low fi with the flow in mind. I tested the 
                        low fidelity wireframes to see if there would be anything wrong 
                        with the flow we set up and found some issues which were addressed 
                        in the id fidelity phase.

                        The mid fidelity phase showed me that the

                        things that needed to be addressed. Possibly 
                        the biggest take away from testing the mid fidelity 
                        prototypes was that I needed to change the word alert 
                        on the “mood alert” which was the KDF. The word alert 
                        was alarming for some testers- they didn’t know if they 
                        should press that button because they related the word 
                        “alert” to an emergency.

                        was a balancing act. I didn’t want to make the app 
                        feminine because the app was aimed at men as well as 
                        females. The persona was female but the app was 
                        supposed to be gender neutral. The colors needed 
                        to be calming colors as well as colors that would 
                        allow the user to trust the app to help them with 
                        their problems and animate situations.

                        The high fidelity wireframes were tested for 
                        desirability and usability. The desirability 
                        tests showed that the app has a strong “playful” 
                        element to it. Specifically the Bitmojii integration 
                        gave off a clear illustration of emotions but also a 
                        less serious tone which made it more playful.

                        scroll shows the calendar with the pattern of 
                        emotions on there.  The reason the calendar if in the 
                        front is to have any patterns in emotions front and center 
                        so they can be addressed if it is mostly negative.

                        To conclude this app was a fun project. 
                        I enjoyed connecting with people and hearing 
                        their stories. Providing a solution for couple to 
                        avoid conflict as well as optimizing their partnership 
                        gives me tons of joy. Couples are burdened by finances, 
                        temptation, emotional trauma from the past, and different 
                        ideologies. The app serves as a safe middle ground to iron 
                        out any relationship flaws and build the relationship to its 
                        full potential. Conflict is inevitable and there is actually 
                        a healthy level of conflict needed in a relationship. 
                        However- conflict can destroy a relationship if it is not 
                        handled with care. This app is here to enable a happily ever 
                        after.
